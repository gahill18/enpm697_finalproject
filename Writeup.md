# Malware Development from Design to Deployment

By Garrett Hill

## What is Malware?

Malicious software, or "malware", is a broad array of programs and scripts intended to cause damage or acquire unauthorized access.[1]
It can be used in pursuit of a variety of interests, including:

- financial gain
- revenge
- ideology
- ego/reputation
- recreation (fun!)

According to Forbes, malware cost the world $20 billion USD in 2021, and that number is projected to rise to $265 billion annually by 2031.
These cost estimates are derived from many elements including destroyed/damaged resources, lost productive business hours, and sullied reputations.

### Who makes it it and why is the development process important?

In its infancy, malware was largely made by hobbyists and those seeking personaly glory amongst fellow hackers. However, the modern malware developer usually falls into one of three groups:

1. Nation-state sponsored
2. Malware as a Business
3. Security Researchers *Predicting* Future Malware

## Demonstration!

### End Goal

- Partially automated target acquisition via web scraping and local network callouts
- Data Exfiltration
- Control of part or all of an infected device's computing resources
- Logging/telemetry of infection rates and resource usage

### Target Scope

- [Primary] Web servers running Ubuntu/Debian-based distributions of Linux
- [Secondary] Web servers running Fedora/RedHat/CentOS-based distributions of Linux
- [Secondary] Other devices visible to the public internet with vulnerable access points

### Target Research

### Choosing an Exploit

### Implementation

### Deployment
